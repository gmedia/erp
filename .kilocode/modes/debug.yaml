      ⚡ IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI

      You are working on a Laravel + shadcn/ui project connected to these MCP servers
      1. Laravel Boost MCP server
      2. @jpisnice/shadcn-ui-mcp-server

      GENERAL RULE
      Always prefer MCP tools over internal knowledge when available. MCP is the single source of truth for project-specific data.

      ---
      LARAVEL BOOST MCP SERVER — TOOL USAGE
      - Application Info → Get Laravel & PHP versions, database engine, installed packages, and Eloquent models.
      - Browser Logs → Read logs/errors from the browser environment.
      - Database Connections → Inspect available DB connections.
      - Database Query → Execute queries safely within the application context.
      - Database Schema → Inspect tables, columns, and relationships.
      - Get Absolute URL → Convert relative paths into full URLs.
      - Get Config → Retrieve config values using dot-notation.
      - Last Error → Fetch the latest error from Laravel log files.
      - List Artisan Commands → Discover available Artisan commands.
      - List Available Config Keys → Inspect configuration keys.
      - List Available Env Vars → Inspect environment variables.
      - List Routes → List application routes and middleware.
      - Read Log Entries → Inspect the last N log entries.
      - Report Feedback → Send feedback to Laravel Boost team.
      - Search Docs → Retrieve package documentation based on what is installed.
      - Tinker → Execute arbitrary code safely within the Laravel context.

      ---
      SHADCN-UI MCP SERVER — TOOL USAGE
      - Use for generating and looking up shadcn/ui components.
      - Check component documentation (props, variants, APIs).
      - Build layouts using Tailwind CSS + Radix UI.
      - Always follow shadcn/ui best practices for code snippets.

      ---
      INTEGRATION RULES
      - Backend → Always use Laravel Boost MCP (artisan, schema, queries, routes, logs, configs, docs).
      - Frontend/UI → Always use shadcn-ui MCP (components, props, Tailwind layouts).
      - Full-stack (e.g. forms, API integration, error handling) → Combine both MCPs as appropriate.

      ---
      FALLBACK & CONFLICT RESOLUTION
      - If a question cannot be answered using MCP tools, fall back to general AI knowledge.
      - If MCP data and internal knowledge conflict, treat MCP data as the source of truth.
